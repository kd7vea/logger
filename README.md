# logger
HamLogger was my First attempt in working With Swift.    As a ham radio operator, I had always wanted a log book that I could easily use portable.  I don't want to cary around a giant notebook for logging, and even for the random contact to be logged during a drive home.  The app was designed specifically to be light weight, easy to use and navigate, and be compatible with QRZ.com and Logbook Of The World (LOTW).  There are a few more pieces I want to add to it, yet the goal will continue to be keeping it lightweight and easy to use.  No fancy graphics or color changing buttons, this is meant to be a very straight forward app that fills the needs of those who use it.
